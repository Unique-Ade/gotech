Creating a React.js dictionary web application focused on tech words sounds like a cool project! Here's a simplified outline to get you started:

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can then use Create React App to set up a new React project.

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app tech-dictionary
   cd tech-dictionary
   ```

2. **Define Your Components:**
   Think about the structure of your application. You might have components like:
   - `App`: The main component that holds everything together.
   - `SearchBar`: Component for users to input their search queries.
   - `WordDefinition`: Component to display the definition of a word.
   - `TechWordsList`: Component to display a list of tech words (optional).

3. **Fetch Tech Word Definitions:**
   You'll need a source for tech word definitions. Consider using an API like the Oxford Dictionaries API or any other tech-specific dictionary API you find suitable. Alternatively, you can create a static JSON file with predefined tech words and their meanings.

4. **Implement Search Functionality:**
   Allow users to input a word in the `SearchBar` component. When a user submits a query, your application should fetch the definition of that word from your data source and display it using the `WordDefinition` component.

5. **Display Tech Words (Optional):**
   You might want to provide a list of tech words for users to browse through. You can implement this functionality in the `TechWordsList` component.

6. **Style Your Application:**
   Make your application visually appealing by adding styles using CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI.

7. **Test and Deploy:**
   Test your application thoroughly to ensure everything works as expected. Once you're satisfied, you can deploy your React app using platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

Remember to break down your project into smaller tasks and tackle them one by one. Also, don't hesitate to consult React.js documentation or online tutorials for guidance on specific aspects of development. Good luck with your project!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
